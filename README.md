# Onboard Bot

The onboard bot script allows users to create events and later on, get feedback about those events. It is meant to be used as an organizational tool.

## Setup

You will need to create a new discord application and within that application create a new bot. Copy the bot's token and create a tokens.json file. Put the token within the json file and label it as "bot".

## Usage Terms and Conditions

The software is provided as is and I accept no liability for any consequences of hosting the bot. Do not redistribute this bot for any sort of commercial gain. You are free to modify the software, but must provide some sort of reference to the original project when posting on your github, or other public repository.
